            <dl>
                <dt>Are all Pokémon forms included?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Almost every Pokémon form is included in the planner. Some cosmetic and transient forms are hidden unless you select the "<abbr title="Miscellaneous">Misc.</abbr> Forms" filter.</p>
                    <p>Forms of the following Pokémon are not in the planner: Pikachu, Genesect, Pumpkaboo, Gourgeist, Xerneas, Mimikyu, Cramorant, Sinistea, Polteageist, and Zarude.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>What are "<abbr title="Miscellaneous">Misc.</abbr> Forms"?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>This (unofficial and arbitrary) category encompasses most cosmetic forms (e.g., patterns of Vivillon or trims of Furfrou), forms of Arceus and Silvally, and battle-only forms (e.g., Ash-Greninja or Original Color Magearna).</p>
                    <p>These forms are initially hidden, but can be selected by activating the corresponding filter. The reason to hide them in the first place is to avoid clutter.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Why are some gender differences not toggable?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Unlike other Pokémon with gender differences, Meowstic, Indeedee, and Basculegion have forms that are more than purely cosmetic changes. Such forms have different movepools, abilities, and/or stats. For this reason, they are treated as distinct Pokémon. Think of it as a similar case to that of Nidoran&female; and Nidoran&male;.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>How is the team analysis calculated?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Only type is used to calculate a Pokémon's weaknesses and resistanteces. Abilities (e.g., Levitate or Wonder Guard) are not factored in.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, coverage calculation only takes into account type and disregards movepool (so Pyukumuku will be marked as contributing to Water coverage, despite it being unable to learn any Water-type damaging moves).</p>
